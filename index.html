    <div class="intro_container"><p class="intro_left">Hi, I'm Nicholas Church, though I commonly go by Nick.<br>
      <br>
      I love learning, and I love data.<br>
      I would rather have an understanding of something simple, than a vague understanding of something complex.<br>
      Can you tell? I wrote this page in HTML and CSS without any back-end framework.<br>
      Simple stuff, I know right? But I'd rather write and understand HTML and CSS than copy a cookie cutter template.<br>
      This is also how I like to approach data, and really anything in my life.<br>
      <br>
      I realize no one has the time to learn everything in detail.<br>
      In my current position as BI Analyst at Marshfield Clinic Health System, I rely on the expertise of my teammates in the healthcare field.<br>
      I love working with them, because almost every day I get to learn something new and contribute to the health system.<br>
      Even better is when I get to take that new knowledge, and communicate directly with the customer to define a solution for their needs.<br>
      <br>
      Please explore a few of my projects that present some of the skills I currently employ.</p>
