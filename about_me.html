            My Journey into Data Analysis:
        </h2>
        <p class="about">
            In 2021, an article sparked my curiosity about data analysis. The idea of leveraging data to solve problems
            and improve efficiency resonated with me, leading me to explore this exciting field. I began by taking the
            Google Data Analytics course on Coursera, and as my interest grew, I actively pursued additional learning
            resources.
        </p>
        <p class="about">
            My background is diverse, encompassing experiences in construction, engineering, system administration and
            Information Technology.
            This has given me a valuable perspective on how businesses operate and what customers truly value. I believe
            this broad lens allows me to better understand stakeholders' needs and translate data into actionable
            insights.
        </p>
